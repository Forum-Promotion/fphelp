Markdown is used to display the content pages of the docs. To edit the docs, find the desired file with the ending .markdown, then click on it. Then click the pencil in the top right corner of the editor. 

Once you've made your changes, click on the green "Commit Changes..." button; from there, you will be asked for a commit message and description of the changes you've made. Ensure the option "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request" is checked. Finally, click "Propose changes".

That will create a new branch and pull request, it will be reviewed and if it checks out then we will approve it. Once approved, the changes will be deployed to GitHub Pages which takes a couple of minutes to complete.
